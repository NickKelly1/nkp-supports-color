## Exports

`@nkp/supports-color` exports both CommonJS and ES modules.

## Fork

`@nkp/supports-color` is a fork of [`supports-color`](https://github.com/chalk/supports-color) that exports both ESM and CommonJS.

In 2021 [Sindre Sorhus](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus), prolific creator and maintainer of many popular [`npm packages`](https://www.npmjs.com/~sindresorhus), [including some with over 150 million weekly monthly downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk), pushed a new major version of many of his packages removing CommonJS support and making them ["pure ESM"](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c). This was a major breaking change. Sindre's universally popular packages were now incompatible with a large parts of the NodeJS ecosystem.

Sindre's packages could have been kept backwards compatible by producing both ESM and CJS exports, however [Sindre believed he could push the NodeJS community to adopt ESM sooner by introducing breaking changes](https://blog.sindresorhus.com/get-ready-for-esm-aa53530b3f77).

> Personally, I plan to (migrate to Pure ESM *instead* of provide backwards compatibility) as I think itâ€™s better to rip off the bandaid and push the ecosystem forward.

[For many, the breaking change's haven't gone over well](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/bca2fda868c1e8b2c2caf76af7dfcad3). Many project's now find themselves spending hours, days or even weeks trying to placate these pure EMS packages only to find too many incompatibilities and revert back.

Hence this fork. `@nkp/supports-color` is intended to be an functionally equivalent clone of `styles-ansi` but with both ESM and CJS exports.

## Publishing

To a release a new version:

2. Push the new version to the `master` branch on GitHub
3. Create a `new release` on GitHub for the latest version

This will trigger a GitHub action that tests and publishes the npm package.
